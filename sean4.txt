I read a Dungeon & Dragons campaign in which player's quest is to inquisit sightings of strange monsters in the wildeness. Turned out to be a 'dungeon crawl' in a crashlanded alien capitalship. Read another story, where the Game Master throughout the campaign - had a villain systematically slaughtering an entire Nation for ritual ascension to God-hood. 
The party of players eventually stopped him by Astral-projecting to the appropriate realm and petitioning an established God to bless their weapons. Except the michevious party thief kept goofing around. Then he failed a saving throw vs the Deity wishing him out of existence. and simply faded away.

Metal shit like that happened in our games sometimes too. D&D is far out.
I could do something like that for a living, as one component of a larger enterprise.
I mean, fuck man think of the merchandise!
